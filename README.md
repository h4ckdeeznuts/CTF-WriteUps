# CTF_WriteUps
=======
This repo contains a list of CTFs I completed for the sake of documenting it. 
May also prove helpful to someone seeking a concise solution!
I have also tried to include some One Liners, which would be ideal for scripting out the solutions where possible (for me)
Let's learn together! Thank you.


>Ironically, most CTFs here are beginner friendly but my solutions might not seem so. Oh well.
>I'll be adding more whenever I can. G'Day!

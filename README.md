# CTF_WriteUps

This repository contains a list of CTFs I completed for the sake of documenting it.
May also prove helpful to someone seeking a concise solution!
I have also tried to include some One Liners, which would be ideal for scripting out the solutions where possible (for me)
Let's learn together! Thank you.

Also, for commands that you see separated by a " ; ", can be executed together. Sort of ..one liners?
Pardon my messy formatting, or say, none at all! Don't forget to scroll side-ways too.


>Ironically, most CTFs here are beginner friendly but some of my solutions may not seem so. Oh well.
>I'll be adding more whenever I can. G'Day!

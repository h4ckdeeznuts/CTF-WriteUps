./check asks for a password. We cant guess one straight away, but we sure can use " ltrace ./check " for some
behind the scenes for this binary, which has a setuid of leviathan2 and can be used to cat out the password
for the same.
We see a line --  strcmp("anyarbitraryword", "sex")  --
Which means that it is looking for the password " sex ", and sure enough, ./check and entering sex gives us a shell!
doing a whoami returns leviathan2
" cat /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan2 "

" cd $(mktemp -d); ln -s /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan3 nothing; touch hereGoes\ nothing; chmod 777 .; ~/printfile hereGoes\ nothing;

Level 3 --> Level 4
We use ltrace to analyze the binary, which seems to expect the password " snlprintf "
First we enter h0no33, then next time running ltrace on the same binary we see - strcmp("kakaka\n", "snlprintf\n")
Thus we get a shell

Level 4 --> Level 5
" cd .trash/ ; ./bin " gives us a binary output which we can convert and obtain our password
echo 01010100 01101001 01110100 01101000 00110100 01100011 01101111 01101011 01100101 01101001 00001010 | perl -lape '$_=pack"(B8)*",@F'

Level 5 --> Level 6
./leviathan5 seems to search for file.log in /tmp and has a setuid. We could use this fact to create a hard-symlink.
" ln -sf /etc/leviathan_pass/leviathan6 /tmp/file.log; ./leviathan5 "
Password for Level 6 is UgaoFee4li


Level 6 --> Level 7
cd $(mktemp -d); nano script.sh; chmod +x script.sh

content of the script:

#!/bin/bash
for i in {0000..9999}
do
echo "Pin : $i"
~/leviathan6 $i
sleep 0.02 #to avoid resource unavailable/ slowdown
done

The program stops midway with a shell, which indicated we got the right 4-digit pin.

CONGRATULATIONS.
End of Leviathan for now.
